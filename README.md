# Tranpy✷

Tranpy is a Python-based file translation tool designed to tackle translations that other bots might not handle as effectively. This is my first Python package, developed for personal use, and I hope it proves helpful to others seeking similar functionality.

## Description

Tranpy is specifically built to translate texts, file contents, and web pages with a focus on deep translation accuracy and maintaining the original file structure in the output. It's perfect for users who need to automate the translation of configuration files, scripts, or any textual content that requires context-aware translation.

## Features

- **Text Translation**: Translate plain text directly from the command line.
- **File Translation**: Automatically translate the contents of files, detecting and preserving the original file format in the translated output.
- **Web Page Translation**: Input a URL and receive a plain text translation of the web page, suitable for readability and further processing.
- **Progress Reporting**: Real-time progress updates during the translation process.
- **Easy to Install and Use**: Simple setup process and straightforward commands.

## Compatible Operating Systems

Tranpy is developed and tested on the following operating systems:
- Linux
- macOS
- Windows (via command line)

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Python 3.6 or higher is required.
2. Install tranpy using pip:
